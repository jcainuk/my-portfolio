          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hello, I am an online TEFL teacher, soon to be web developer.</p>
          <p>I love yoga, the internet, technology, learning languages and gaming.</p>

          <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
          <p>I'm originally from glamourous Bolton in the north west of England which actually has a really interesting history and has produced some of the UK's greatest entertainers! Boltonians are some of the friendliest people in the the country. </p>
              
        <p>At the same time I have a Maltese mum so when I'm not here in the UK I often escape to sunnier climbs to see my family. See the video below (..yes it's lovely!) </p>

          <h2>More About Me</h2>
          <h3>What is your favourite hobby?</h3>
          <p>My favorite hobby is yoga. I've been practising it for over ten years and even worked as a yoga teacher at one point. When I'm not doing that I love learning how to do new things on the internet such as building simple websites, filming Vlogs and learning how to code.</p>

          <h3>What would be your dream job?</h3>
          <p>My dream job would be to work as a developer building anything from language learning apps to games</p>
          
          <h3>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h3>
          <p>Because programming is awesome, it is the new literacy and opens so many opportunityies for people.</p>
