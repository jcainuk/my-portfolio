      <h2>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan. I am an <a href="https://www.italki.com/jcain-esol" target="_blank">online
            English teacher</a> and I'm training to become a junior web
          developer with <a href="https://www.manchestercodes.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Codes</a>. I love yoga,
          the
          internet, technology, learning languages and gaming.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What is it like to teach English online?</h3>
        <p>No two days are the same! I teach a variety of adult students from countries all around the world
          from Spain to Kazakhstan. My students need English for everything from business to acting! I really
          never know what to expect.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h3>
        <p>Because programming is awesome, it is the new literacy and opens up so many opportunities for people.
        </p>

        <h3>What would be your dream job?</h3>
        <p>My dream job would be to work as a developer building anything from language learning apps to games
          but really the sky's the limit!
        </p>
        <h3>What do you like about coding?</h3>
        <p>Coding is fundamentally about creating solutions to problems. At the end of the day, if you have created
          something that didn’t exist that morning then that in and of itself is satisfying.</p>

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
      <p>I'm originally from glamorous Bolton in the north west of England which actually has a really interesting
        history and has produced some of the UK's greatest entertainers! Boltonians are some of the
        <em>friendliest</em>
        people in the the country.
        At the same time I have a Maltese mum so when I'm not here in the UK I often escape to sunnier climbs to
        see my family.</p>

      <h3>What is your favourite hobby?</h3>
      <p>My favourite hobby is yoga. I've been practising it for over ten years and even worked as a yoga teacher
        at one point. When I'm not doing that I love learning how to do new things on the internet such as
        building simple websites, filming Vlogs and learning how to code.</p>
